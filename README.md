## What is it?
remove-pip-virus will patch a python module that is being shared around github, called adm4.  
This malicious module installs a virus and sends personal files on a webhook.  
remove-pip-virus will modify the module code to not install the virus.  
If the virus is already present, it will kill it if it is running and replace the virus executable with a dummy file to prevent writing.  

## How to set up
In the console, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to run
In an [elevated console](https://grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=18026&printable=y), navigate to repository directory and run `py main.py`.  

It is recommended you do not uninstall the patched module otherwise you risk the malicious module being installed at a later point.
